            <p>Lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's
                standard
                dummy
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining
                essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
                Lorem
                Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                versions
                of
                Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <h2>a junior web developer</h2>
            <p id="a-2-p">I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my
                grandma how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics. I am learning and
                mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.
